Title: Build the HTTr Database For Use by The CCD
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ricahrd Judson
Maintainer: Richard Judson <judson.richard@epa.gov>
Description: This package loads signature concentration-response data into the 
  httr database so that it can be picked up by the CompTox Dashboard. The required
  files are the concentration-response data fiels and the signature catalogs. Currently,
  there are jsuta few files in the data directory to show how this runs. When this is 
  really running, the data directory may need to get changed. The only function
  that needs to be run is buildHTTrDB.R. The MySQL Workbench file to construct
  the empty database is in the mysql folder.
